      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am an aspiring Web Developer and Designer. I also received a Bachelor's degree in Psychology.<br>
        I have a wide range of interests (most especially in arts), including photography, illustration or drawing, graphic design, interior design (furniture and décor), as well as
        organic agriculture production. I also enjoy singing and dancing (not just for exercise); going to cafes or restaurants; traveling to far-off places on the planet, experience new cultures and see life differently! Finally, adventure is one of
        my favorite things: being outdoors makes me feel alive. Although I am a Jack-of-all-trades, I also acknowledge that there is always room for improvement as there are still many things that I have yet to learn. It's important for me to keep
        learning new things and improving on the old ones.</p>

      <h2>My Skills.</h2>
      <div class="skill-row-1">
        <img class="talent-search-img" src="images/talent-search.gif" alt="talent acquisition gif">
        <h3>Talent Acquisition</h3>
        <p>My educational background in Psychology has given me adequate knowledge of the Human Resources Industry.
          My on-the-job training has given me the opportunity to be exposed to various facets of the human resources
          department especially in Recruitment and other HR-related functions or administrative tasks which urged me to
          apply my training and develop my skill in searching & acquisitioning talents.</p>

      <div class="skill-row-2">
        <img class="girl-code-img" src="images/girl-code.gif" alt="web development and design gif">
        <h3 class="skill-row-2-title">Development & Design</h3>
        <p>I started learning how to code to develop my problem solving and logical skills; enhance my creativity
          and embrace technology. How wonderful would that be if I could tackle and tinker my own problem head on.
          Also, coding can be useful in jobs that I might not expect. As a psychology graduate, I found out that most
          jobs need to be computer literate and for example, if I'll head on to the career path as an HR, maybe a recruiter
          or any fields, it'll be advantageous for me if I know how to code, it would make my job become convenient and less difficult.</p>

        <h3 class="">Photography</h3>
        <p>In my late teens, photography was just a hobby. Up until now, this is my way of keeping memories
          and have something to look back to. Aside from capturing memorable moments, I eventually get
          attracted to interiors and landscapes that are aesthetically pleasing to my eye. Over time, I realized
          to learn more than just taking pictures and dig deeper into the art of photography.</p>
